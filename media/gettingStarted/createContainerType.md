## Creating an app registration and trial container type

To start building with SharePoint Embedded, you will first need to create or choose an existing app registration in Microsoft Entra ID. Then you will create a trial container type linked to your app registration. A container type is a SharePoint Embedded resource that defines the access privileges, behaviors, and billing accountability between your SharePoint Embedded application and its containers. [Trial container types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/embedded/concepts/app-concepts/containertypes#trial-use) work for 30 days with limitations.
